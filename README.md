Copley Motion Library (C++) Examples

What is CML?
-	CML is the Copley Motion Library. 
	It is written in C++ and is proprietary source code. 
	To purchase CML, please contact Copley Controls Corporation. 
	There are a variety of licensing options available. 
	CML is compatible with Windows, Linux, and QNX operating systems. 

CML Features:
-	CML implements the CANopen protocol for motion control over CAN or EtherCAT networks with Copley products. 
	The applications are limitless as CML supports the maximum number of nodes per network as defined by the protocol standard: 
	- 127 for CAN networks
	- 65,535 for EtherCAT networks
-	Real-time messaging through synchronous PDO’s and asynchronous SDO’s.
-	Linkage moves up to 32 axes of coordinated motion.
-	Control of any analog or digital I/O module compliant to the DS401 standard (Wago I/O, Copley I/O, Beckhoff EK1100, etc.).
-	Control of any EtherCAT device, even simple ESC devices that do not support mailbox protocols (CoE).
-	PVT streaming capabilities with built-in velocity calculation for smooth motion profiles.
